This case study covers a predictive analysis case study, focusing on estimating property prices in the Delhi region using multiple linear regression and Decision Trees. Hereâ€™s a brief overview:

Problem Definition: The goal is to build a model that predicts property prices based on various features. Data Loading and Exploration: The notebook starts by loading housing data, then explores it using pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib for data structure inspection, descriptive statistics, and visualization. Data Visualization: Initial data visualizations include pair plots and box plots, which examine relationships between price and various categorical/numerical features. Data Preparation: The notebook includes steps for preparing data for modeling, such as handling categorical variables, missing values, or data scaling. Model Building and Evaluation: The final sections involve building both a multiple linear regression model and a Decision Tree model using scikit-learn, followed by evaluating model accuracy, fit, and possibly testing or validating the models with different metrics.
